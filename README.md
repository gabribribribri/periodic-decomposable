# periodic-decomposable
Check if a String can be written using only Periodic Table elements.

I wrote this in a middle of a Shikanoko Nokonoko Koshitantan watching seance on a web editor.
I will refactor it to be less ugly later.
For now I will remade this in python so I can use it in my calculator :>
